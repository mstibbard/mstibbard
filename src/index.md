I'm an independent consultant, VP-level product and engineering leader, startup
advisor, and father of 2. I write about product, engineering, consulting, and
startups.

Throughout my career I've had the opportunity to work at some of the world's
leading companies. I've helped transform businesses and products from startups to Fortune 500
companies.

I now teach teams and organisations how to innovate and modernise their products
and services with a scientific approach -- measuring, iterating, adjusting and
focusing on the right things.
